# HRSD QMRA Stochastic Model and App

# Purpose
  The app that is the primary reason for this repository. This app is meant for HRSD personnel to be able to interact with and use the stochastic quantitative microbial risk analysis (QMRA) model. The app is built using Shiny and therefore can be downlaoded in entirety from this repository and by using RStudio can be easily used. This will be the primary use of the model until OSU returns from COVID-19 shutdown to allow access to an app hosting server for this work.
